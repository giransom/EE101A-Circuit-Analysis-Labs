The lab was divided into two main parts:

1. Characterizing the tranformer
  - after soldering the connetor piece, the transformer output was analyzed for different voltages including:
    - DC voltage
    - AC square waves
    - AC sinusodial waves

2. Recitifier
  -after building a full wave rectifier we utilized oscilloscope to analyze the output
