For this lab we added to the previously built part from Lab1_Rectifier was broken up into 3 main parts:

1. attaching and testing the capacitor
   - attached a 1000 mirco farade capacitor
   - tested and measured the output voltage

2. attaching and testing the zener diode
   -attached an 1N4749A semiconducting zener diode
   -tested and measured the output voltage

3. tested a reistor load from the output of zener diode
   - tested a: 10 kilo Ohms, 1 kilo Ohms, and 470 Ohms resistiors
   - recorded loads voltage and ripple size
